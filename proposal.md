# Image Translator
## *Team Name*
### Team Members: Andy Liu(team manager), Yucheng Ma, Yiming Sun, Dakota Williams 

### 1: Intro
<p>   Our idea is to create a computer application that will recognize words in a picture, from many different alphabets, and translate it to English and other languages. We hope that this will make it easier for tourists and students to communicate and take notes. Sometimes professors talk/write too fast, and the only option left for these students is to take pictures. This is where our program will come in. With our program, students can easily translate their pictures they take in classes and explain it to languages they are comfortable in. Also, for tourists, when people go to foreign countries, it is hard to go anywhere. You will not be able to communicate with others (unless they know English or you know other languages) or understand their written language. It might be easy to translate language such as Spanish where you can type the word into your mobile translator. However, for a language such as Chinese or Japanese, there no way foreigners will know how to type the word into the translator. Our program can help with that. Just take a picture and have those foreign words translated for you. </p>
 
### 2: Customer Value
<p> Our primary customers will be international students. It's hard for some students to read/take notes especially if the class is not in their native tongue. We hope to provide them with a solution to this by being able to translate either written or powerpoint slides. Students can spend more take thinking instead of try understand what that word mean.  </p>

<p> There exist many translators, but not many credible translator that can translate words in image. We try to create an easy to use, and reliable program that can do accurrate translation. There will be no hassle when using our program, and truly help our customers. Our program can help our customers translate any languages for them. It will save them when traveling or help international translate their photo.</p>


### 3: Proposed Solution & Technology
<p> For this program, we are going to use python.We will rely on Google cloud platform and use their API. For now, we have choose to use Google vision API to detect the text from image, and the google translation API to translate the text. We have not determined way to build GUI, we will decide it later. </p>

### 4: Team
#### <p>Nobody on the team has developed anything like this before, but Wiliiams have two years experience of using Python. None of us have used the Google APIs before. We hope to use this as a learning experience to better our development skills. </p>
