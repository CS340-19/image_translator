## *Team Name*
### Team Members: Andy Liu, Yucheng Ma, Yiming Sun, Dakota Williams 

### 1: Intro
<p>Our idea is to create a computer application that will recognize words ina picture, from many different alphabets, and translate it to english and other languages. We hope that this will make it easier for tourists and students to communicate and take notes.</p>

##### What existing software does it resemble? How is it different?
##### Team member backgrounds:

### 2: Customer Value
<p> Our primary customers will be students. It's hard for some students to read/take notes especially if the class is not in their native tongue. We hope to provide them with a solution to this by being able to translate either written or powerpoint slides.</p>

##### Ask someone about the idea and see what they think.
##### What are our measures of success? Customer-centric measures?

### 3: Proposed Solution & Technology
#### <p>We try to use Google vision API to detect the text from image, and the google translation API to translate the text.</p>
##### Future improvements?
##### How do we test?

### 4: Team
#### <p>Nobody on the team has developed anything like this before, so we hope to use this as a learning experience to better our development skills. None of us have used the Google APIs before.</p>
##### What are our roles?

### 5: Project Management
#### Schedule:
#### Constraints:
#### Resources:
#### Descoping
